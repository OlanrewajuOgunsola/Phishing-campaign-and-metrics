# Phishing-campaign-and-metrics

## 1. Overview
This project documents a phishing simulation conducted to measure employee vigilance against credential-harvesting attacks following a phishing-awareness training programme.  
The exercise aimed to reduce link-click frequency, minimize credential submission attempts, and improve incident reporting within the organisation.

---

## 2. Objectives
- Lower link-click rate among targeted employees  
- Increase phishing incident reports submitted to the security team  
- Reduce credential submission attempts on the phishing landing page  

---

## 3. Compliance Drivers
- **ISO/IEC 27001 (Annex A 6.3):** Requires measurable user-awareness controls  
- **Internal Risk Register:** Tracks progress against social-engineering risks  

---

## 4. Tooling
- **Zphisher:** Generated the phishing site and captured interaction data  
- **Localxpose:** Enabled optional port-forwarding for internal access during testing  
- **Google Sheets:** Used to store and analyse key performance indicators

## 5. Simulation Scenario
A crafted invoice-reminder email was sent to selected employees, requesting payment for WordPress services.  
The message included a link directing recipients to a cloned login page hosted with Zphisher.

## 6. Metrics

| KPI                   | Baseline | Post-Campaign |
|------------------------|----------|---------------|
| Link clicks           | 80%      | 30%           |
| Credential submissions | 60%      | 20%           |
| Phishing reports      | 10%      | 80%           |

---

## 7. Analysis
- Link-click frequency dropped by **50 percentage points**, indicating improved caution.  
- Credential submission attempts decreased by **40 percentage points**, reflecting stronger scepticism.  
- Reporting rate increased by **70 percentage points**, demonstrating proactive security behaviour.  

---

## 8. Recommendations
- Schedule quarterly phishing simulations to maintain user awareness.  
- Deliver refresher training to employees who clicked links or submitted credentials.  
- Integrate live phishing-report metrics into the security dashboard for real-time visibility.  

---

## 9. Conclusion
The phishing simulation provided measurable evidence of improved employee vigilance.  
The results support continued investment in user-focused security controls and align with **ISO 27001 requirements** and the organisation’s risk-management objectives.
